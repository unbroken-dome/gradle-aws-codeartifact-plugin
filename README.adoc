This plugin improves support for using AWS CodeArtifact Maven repositories from a Gradle build.

The "standard" way of working with AWS CodeArtifact in Gradle, as recommended by the
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/maven-gradle.html[AWS Documentation], requires
users to fetch an authorization token before the build and pass it to Gradle as an environment variable.This
has several drawbacks:

- It requires users (or CI agents) to have the AWS CLI installed in order to run builds.
- It requires users (or CI agents) to perform an extra step before the build.
- Expiration of tokens will be noticed by users only through build failures, to which the resolution may not be clear.
- Always fetching an authorization token preemptively can be wasteful, because for the majority of builds, Gradle will
reuse artifacts from its local disk cache instead of downloading them.

Using this plugin lets you declare your CodeArtifact repositories in a Gradle `repositories` block in a more
convenient way, and removes the need to fetch authentication tokens before the build.


== Quickstart

1. Apply the plugin to your _settings_ script:
+
.settings.gradle / settings.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin,subs="+attributes"]
----
plugins {
    id("org.unbroken-dome.aws.codeartifact") version "{version}"
}
----
+

2. Use the `codeArtifact` extension when declaring a Maven repository, instead of the `url`.
Leave out the `credentials`.
+
[source,kotlin]
----
repositories {
    maven {
        codeArtifact {
            domain = "my-domain"
            domainOwner = "123456789012"
            repositoryName = "my-repo"
        }
    }
}
----
+
You can use this extension almost anywhere where you can declare a repository, including the `publishing` block,
a `buildscript` block, and the and `dependencyManagement` in your settings script.
(For `pluginManagement` things are a bit more complicated; see <<_using_gradle_plugins_from_an_aws_codeartifact_repository>> below.)

3. Pass the AWS credentials to your Gradle build, for example using environment variables:
+
[source,bash]
----
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
./gradlew build
----
+
See <<_aws_credentials>> for details.


== How It Works

Unfortunately, Gradle offers very limited possibilities to hook into the artifact resolution process or rewrite the
requests to a Maven repository when the dependencies are resolved.In addition, resolution of artifacts (including
Gradle plugins) can happen very early in the configuration phase of a Gradle build.

The plugin's solution to this is launching a local proxy server as a build-scoped service, which acts as a temporary
Maven repository.The proxy forwards all calls to the correct AWS CodeArtifact endpoint, takes care of endpoint
resolution and automatically fetches authorization tokens when required.In addition to taking advantage of Gradle's
lazy evaluation features, the proxy server itself acts lazily: it will only make calls to AWS APIs (or even initialize
the AWS API clients) once a dependency is actually requested.This way, there is only minimal overhead for the majority
of builds that do not require fetching dependencies from a remote repository.


[#_aws_credentials]
== AWS Credentials

The proxy server that is launched by the plugin needs AWS credentials to fetch endpoint URLs and tokens for AWS
CodeArtifact repositories.

As the proxy server is built using the AWS SDK for Java, it supports passing the credentials via Java system properties
(e.g. `aws.profile`) and environment variables (e.g. `AWS_PROFILE`) as described in the
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html[SDK documentation].

[TIP]
====
One way to set Java system properties for a Gradle build is to declare them with the `systemProp.` prefix in a
`gradle.properties` file.For example:

.gradle.properties
[source,properties]
----
systemProp.aws.profile=gradle-build
----
====

In addition, the plugin supports the Gradle project properties `aws.accessKeyId`, `aws.secretAccessKey`, `aws.profile`
and `aws.region` for convenience.These can be declared in a `gradle.properties` file or on the command line with the
`-P` switch.If these properties are present, they will have higher precedence than the other mechanisms like
system properties or environment variables.


== Where to Apply the Plugin

In contrast to most Gradle plugins, which typically work only on a `Project`, this plugin supports being applied to
different targets:

- the *settings* script (`Settings` object, file name `settings.gradle.kts` or `settings.gradle`).
+
This is the recommended usage.

- a *project* build script (`Project` object, file name `build.gradle.kts` or `build.gradle`).
+
Use this only when building very simple projects without multi-modules and without a settings script.
Applying the plugin to your settings script will automatically apply it to every project in the build.

- an *init* script (`Gradle` object, file name `~/.gradle/init.gradle` or specified with `--init-script`).
+
This has some limitations, but may be necessary when using other Gradle plugins that are hosted in an AWS
CodeArtifact repository (see below).


== Caching AWS CodeArtifact Tokens

Authorization tokens for AWS CodeArtifact are cached in memory, for the duration of a single build (i.e., an invocation
of Gradle).


[#_using_gradle_plugins_from_an_aws_codeartifact_repository]
== Using Gradle Plugins from an AWS CodeArtifact Repository

A special case arises when using Gradle plugins hosted in an AWS CodeArtifact repository.Resolution of Gradle plugin
artifacts happens much earlier than other dependencies, so even applying this plugin to the settings script will not
allow you to configure repositories in the following places:

- Repositories in a `pluginManagement` block of a settings script:
+
The `pluginManagement` is used for both settings plugins and project plugins; unfortunately Gradle does not offer a
separate block for settings plugin management.Therefore, the `pluginManagement` block in a settings script will be
evaluated before any settings plugins are applied.

- repositories in a `buildscript` block of a settings script

There are two possible solutions to this:

1. *Use `buildscript` blocks instead of `pluginManagement`* (project plugins only).
+
You can use a `beforeProject` block in your settings script to apply a buildscript to all projects:
+
.settings.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
beforeProject {
    buildscript {
        repositories {
            maven {
                codeArtifact {
                    // ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

2. *Apply the AWS CodeArtifact plugin to an init script*
+
Another solution would be to apply the plugin even one step earlier, to an init script.
+
The standard location for an init script is `~/.gradle/init.gradle`, but you can also specify it on the Gradle
command line using the `--init-script` or `-I` option.That way you can keep the init script under version
control as well.
+
[NOTE]
====
A Gradle init script does not have access to project-level properties, even if they are passed on
the command line. For this reason, when used in an init script the plugin will launch a separate CodeArtifact proxy
server which only considers the standard environment variables and system properties for AWS credentials
(`AWS_PROFILE` etc.) but will not consider project-level Gradle properties.
